🩸 AnemiaSense - Anemia Detection Using Machine Learning

🚀 Project Overview

AnemiaSense is a machine learning-powered web application designed to detect anemia based on user-provided blood parameters. It provides a simple web interface (Flask) where users can enter their hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels and get an instant anemia prediction.

🔹 Features

✅ Web-based UI (built with Flask, HTML, CSS)✅ Uses Machine Learning to predict anemia✅ Trained on real anemia datasets✅ User-friendly input form for blood parameters✅ Displays prediction results instantly
